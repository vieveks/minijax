# GPT with JAX

This project is a basic implementation of a GPT-like language model using JAX and Haiku. It's designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how to build and train a transformer model from scratch.

## **Project Structure**

- `main.py`: Entry point for training or evaluating the model.
- `model.py`: Defines the GPT model architecture.
- `data.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
- `train.py`: Contains the training loop.
- `evaluate.py`: Code for generating text using the trained model.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for saving and loading the model.
- `config.py`: Configuration settings and hyperparameters.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
